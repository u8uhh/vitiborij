        more. The most popular languages are: html, javascript and python. Html in the main we use for web development, in html we can do sites. By javascript we can do computer games, add something for sites. Python in the main we use for doing computer
        games, by python of course we can do something, for example: calculator, fractals. By C# in 100% we can develop computer games. Of course we have programs for developing games there blockly, scratch and kodu game lab. On these rograms we have
        blocks , which by we need build programme. Windows developed by C++. We have a good language of programming arduino. This language used for robotics. By arduino we can develop a robots witch will do command, for example: collect a cubic rubik,
        live just like a human, work registrar. By javascript people Markus Perrson created popular game Minecraft.</h5>
